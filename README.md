# Procedural-Planets-in-Unity
Test project for creating procedural (currently earth-like) planets using Unity 2018 (can be updated I guess). 
Please use Lightweight Render Pipeline.

Mesh generation code is from Sebastian Lague (https://www.youtube.com/user/Cercopithecan),
noise code from libnoise.net.
All the rest is from me.

The project has other files and disabled objetcs in the scene, just ignore them.

Please consider that this is just a beta and you can update your own custom values for RNG inside the wiki.
Also consider that I'm just 15 and a rather unexperienced developer, and that I know that my code is 
extremely unoptimised and slow.
